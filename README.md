# YouTube Subscriptions

This script monitors selected YouTube channels and automatically adds new videos to your playlists.
It is built with Google Apps Script and the YouTube Data API v3.

## Features

- Detects and adds the latest videos from your favorite channels to playlists.
- Avoids duplicates by keeping track of the last added videos.
- Supports optional automation with time-driven triggers.
- Lists all your playlists and subscriptions to simplify the initial setup.
- Provides clear, detailed logs for every execution.
- Free and open source. :sunglasses:

## Setup

1. **Create a Google Apps Script project**

   - Open [Google Apps Script](https://script.google.com/) and create a new project.
   - For each file in the [Source](Source) directory, create a matching file in the Apps Script editor (using the **+** button in the left panel) and copy its contents.

2. **Enable the YouTube Data API v3**

   - In the **Services** menu (on the left panel), add **YouTube Data API v3**.

3. **List all your playlists and subscriptions**

   - In the Apps Script editor, select the `listMyPlaylists` function and click **Run**.
   - Authorize the script if it’s your first time running it.
   - In the **Execution log** panel, you will see a list of all your playlists along with their IDs. Write them down.
   - Repeat the steps with the `listMySubscriptions` function.

4. **Configure settings**

   - Open the `Settings.gs` file on the left and replace the placeholders (`PLAYLIST_1_ID`, `CHANNEL_1_1_ID`, etc.) with the identifiers noted in the previous step.
   - At the end, the file should look similar to this:

     ```javascript
     const settings = {
       playlists: {
         "PLrEoTTPGndRblAh27ns3MOHZldAilErI6": [ // Science
           "UCsXVk37bltHxD1rDPwtNM8Q",           // Kurzgesagt – In a Nutshell
           "UCHnyfMqiRRG1u-2MsSQLbXA",           // Veritasium
         ],
         "PLrEoTTPGndRYOD03tciWWVZ5hhpDsKVYW": [ // IT
           "UCpIn7ox7j7bH_OFj7tYouOQ",           // John Savill's Technical Training
         ],
       }
     };
     ```

5. **Run manually for the first time**

   - In the Apps Script editor, select the `addNewVideosToPlaylists` function and click **Run**.
   - If everything is set up correctly, you should see in the **Execution log** that all specified channels were detected as new and the last video from each was added to the corresponding playlist.
   - If you run it again, no additional videos should be added (unless new ones have been published since).

6. **Optional: set up a time-driven trigger**

   - Go to **Triggers** (alarm clock icon on the left).
   - Click **Add Trigger** in the bottom-right corner.
   - Select the function: `addNewVideosToPlaylists`.
   - Choose the trigger type: **Time-driven → Hour timer**.
   - Select frequency: e.g., **Every hour**.
   - Click **Save**.

> [!TIP]
> Running the script on an hourly schedule is recommended.
> This schedule should not exceed the daily YouTube Data API quota, while still keeping your playlists updated quickly.
