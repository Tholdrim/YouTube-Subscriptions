- Provides clear, detailed logs for every execution.
- Free and open source. :sunglasses:

## Setup

### Getting started

Let’s start with the basics — setting everything up so the script can do its job.

<details>
  <summary>1. Create a Google Apps Script project</summary>

  - Open [Google Apps Script](https://script.google.com/) and create a new project.
    
  - For each file in the [Source](Source) directory, create a matching file in the Apps Script editor (using the **+** button in the left panel) and copy its contents.
</details>
<details>
  <summary>2. Enable the YouTube Data API v3</summary>
  
  - <p>In the <strong>Services</strong> menu (on the left panel), add <strong>YouTube Data API v3</strong>.</p>
</details>
<details>
  <summary>3. List all your playlists and subscriptions</summary>

  - In the Apps Script editor, make sure the `Main.gs` file is selected in the left panel, then choose `listMyPlaylists` from the function menu and click **Run**.
    
  - In the Apps Script editor, select the `listMyPlaylists` function and click **Run**.
    
  - Authorize the script if it’s your first time running it.
    
  - In the **Execution log** panel, you will see a list of all your playlists along with their IDs. Write them down.

  - Repeat the steps with the `listMySubscriptions` function.
</details>
<details>
<summary>4. Configure settings</summary>

  - Open the `Settings.gs` file on the left and replace the placeholders (`PLAYLIST_1_ID`, `CHANNEL_1_1_ID`, etc.) with the identifiers noted in the previous step.
    
  - At the end, the file should look similar to this:
    
    ```javascript
    const settings = {
      playlists: {
        "PLrEoTTPGndRYOD03tciWWVZ5hhpDsKVYW": [ // IT
          "UCpIn7ox7j7bH_OFj7tYouOQ",           // John Savill's Technical Training
        ],
        "PLrEoTTPGndRblAh27ns3MOHZldAilErI6": [ // Science
          "UCsXVk37bltHxD1rDPwtNM8Q",           // Kurzgesagt – In a Nutshell
          "UCHnyfMqiRRG1u-2MsSQLbXA",           // Veritasium
        ],
      }
    };
    ```
</details>
<details>
  <summary>5. Run manually for the first time</summary>

  - In the Apps Script editor, select the `addNewVideosToPlaylists` function and click **Run**.
    
  - If everything is set up correctly, you should see in the **Execution log** that all specified channels were detected as new and the last video from each was added to the corresponding playlist.
    
  - If you run it again, no additional videos should be added (unless new ones have been published since).
</details>

### Advanced setup

Once the basics are in place, you can refine your setup further with additional options.

#### Set up a time-driven trigger

> [!TIP]
> Running the script on an hourly schedule is recommended. This schedule should not exceed the daily YouTube Data API quota, while still keeping your playlists updated quickly.

- Go to **Triggers** (alarm clock icon on the left).
- Click **Add Trigger** in the bottom-right corner.
- Select the function: `addNewVideosToPlaylists`.
- Choose the trigger type: **Time-driven → Hour timer**.
- Select frequency: e.g., **Every hour**.
- Click **Save**.

#### Using Brand Accounts

YouTube Brand Accounts cannot be directly authenticated in Google Apps Script. To work around this limitation, you can share playlists between them and your main Google account:

- In your Brand Account, create the playlist you want to use.
- Open the playlist settings and share it with edit permissions to your main Google account.
- Copy the playlist ID and configure it in `Settings.gs` just like any other playlist.
- When the script runs, videos will be added via your main account, but into a playlist that belongs to the Brand Account.
